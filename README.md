# React technical test

Mock was implemented. I tried to maintain clean and logical project structure. The collage above presents in short how it looks within different sizes. It scales well in browser and presents itself alike to the mock one. Iphone 5/SE has too small resolution to display it, but it works fine with a scrollbar.

The design was very confusing and gimmicky with arbitrary differences in both navigation items order and other petty details, but I believe it was intentional for the challenge. I've attempted to recreate it as closely as possible without designing separate views for mobile and desktop, which was challenging and fun. I think the result is pretty satisfying.
